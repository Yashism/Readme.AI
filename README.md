# Readme.ai
Readme.ai is an application that streamlines the process of summarizing the contents of GitHub repositories. The application takes a GitHub repository URL as user input, processes the files within the repository, uses Vector DBs and advanced language models, and presents this readme file for quick review and reference.

Manually creating comprehensive README files can be time-consuming and error-prone. Readme.ai leverages the power of advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically generate informative and well-structured README files for your repositories.

With Readme.ai, developers can save time and effort in documenting their projects by simply providing a link to their GitHub repository. The project intelligently extracts relevant information from the codebase and generates a README that includes key details, instructions, and explanations.

## Installation Instructions

To set up and run Readme.ai on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Readme.ai repository to your local environment:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/username/Readme.ai.git
cd Readme.ai
</pre>


3. Obtain your OpenAI API key and replace `"OPENAI_API_KEY"` in the code with your actual API key.

4. Run the Flask application:
<pre>
flask run
</pre>

5. Open a web browser and navigate to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the Readme.ai interface.

## Usage Instructions
